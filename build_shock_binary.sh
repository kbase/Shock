# This script is intended to be run as a docker volume mount in
# /kb/deployment/bin
# Build the Shock executable and copy it into the /kb/deployment/bin directory
# This script expects that the environment variable COMMIT be a git commit hash
# that represents the commit within the Shock repo to build
# ___NOTE___ because the commit hash is generated from the local repo,
# but this script pulls from github, you must push your current repo to
# github before the $COMMIT hash passed into this script is valid
